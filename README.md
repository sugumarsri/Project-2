Human Face Detector:

The code detects human faces in real-time using a webcam and highlights them by drawing rectangles around the detected faces.
Utilized Python , Open CV (library) for development.

Key Features:

--->Real-time face detection using a webcam.
--->Utilizes Haar Cascade, a pre-trained face detection model.
--->Highlights detected faces with rectangles.

How It Works:

--->The code captures video from the webcam frame by frame.
--->Each frame is processed to detect faces using a pre-trained model.
--->Detected faces are highlighted with rectangles, and the results are displayed live.
--->The user can terminate the application by pressing 'q'.
